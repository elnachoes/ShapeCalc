# ShapeCalc

#this is a basic calculator app I created to explore some OO concepts such as, inheritance, interfaces, enumerations, ect.
I also created this app to play around with some python libraries such as Matplotlib and Numpy.

#As of right now the calculator can only 2 different kinds of calculations.It can calculate a few regular polygons,
find their areas, perimeters, and graph them. It can graph linear, square, and cubic functions on a graph.

#to use the application, you have to run the application with a python interpreter as of right now but I plan on
writing a basic C script so that anyone can use this application if they want to without knowing how to use it with
a python interpeter.

#to launch the application you have to run the python script Program.py in the directory. From there, the application will
ask for what kind of calculation you want it to execute and the parameters of that calculation. 

#NOTE: This is a hobby project of mine and it's still in early development but it does work for basic graphical calculations.
I plan on keeping this project updated now and then when I have time to work on it.
